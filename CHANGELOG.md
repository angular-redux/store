# 6.6.0 - Angular 5 Support 

* Add Angular 5+ as peer dependency 

# 7.0.0 - Angular 5 Upgrade

* Update dependencies to Angular 5 
* Update RxJS to 5.5.2 and use lettable operators 
* Update peer dependencies to only Angular 5+

note: This version requires Angular 5, the code generated by the compiler is not compatible with Angular v4.


# 6.6.0-1

* Update peer dependency to include Angular 5, *note* - this is a beta release, if you run into any issues with Angular 5 please let me know. This release is still using an older version of angular to build / compile, but seems to work with Angular 5.

Working on a V7 release that upgrades to be built/use Angular 5 core/compiler/etc which produces builds that are not backwards compatable with Angular 4. More details will be available soon.

** You'll want to grab this update! **

# 6.5.3

* Handle `@WithSubStore`, `.configureSubStore` boundary cases for when the base path
doesn't exist in the store yet.

# 6.5.2

* Docgen updates.

# 6.5.1

* Allow `@WithSubStore`'s base path to be dynamic.

# 6.5.0

* Enabled fractal store features for the decorator interface. See
https://github.com/angular-redux/store/blob/master/articles/fractal-store.md for details.

# 6.4.5

* Fix a boundary condition where `MockNgRedux` could get instantiated
twice under certain conditions.
* Adjust exposed interfaces of `MockNgRedux` and `NgRedux` to make them
structurally compatible (both assignable to the `NgRedux` type) (issue #419)
* Update to TypeScript 2.3.4

# 6.4.4

* Improve packaging of `testing` submodule for people working in strict mode (thanks @ialibhay)!

# 6.4.3

* Reset `MockNgRedux.mockInstance` as part of `MockNgRedux.reset()`.

# 6.4.2

* Fixed some issues with MockNgRedux and the select dectorators. See https://github.com/angular-redux/store/issues/413 for details.

# 6.4.1

* Fixed a memory leak with `@select`, `@select$`. See https://github.com/angular-redux/example-app/issues/34 for details.

# 6.4.0

## Features

* Added 'fractal store' support.

You can now create an encapsulated 'sub-store' that only operates on a section of the global Redux store:

```typescript
const subStore = ngRedux.configureSubStore(
  ['path', 'to', 'somewhere'],
  localReducer)
```

Substore has the same interface as `NgRedux`: `select`, `dispatch` etc;
however when these functions are called on a substore instance, they
are scoped to the data under `path.to.somewhere`.

See [the docs](https://github.com/angular-redux/store/blob/master/articles/fractal-store.md) for more info.

# 6.3.0

## Fixes

* Fixed issues with middlewares that allow dispatching of things other than just raw actions
(e.g. redux-thunk) [#386, #264].
* Fixed issues with enhancers that change the way `Store.subscribe` and listeners work (e.g. redux-batch) [#372]

## Features

* Added the `@select$` decorator which allows you to attach observable operator chains
directly to `@select`. For example:

```typescript
import { select$ } from 'angular-redux/store';

export const debounceAndTriple = obs$ => obs$
  .debounce(300)
  .map(x => 3 * x);

class Foo {
  @select$(['foo', 'bar'], debounceAndTriple)
  readonly debouncedFooBar$: Observable<number>;
}
```

* Added the `@dispatch` decorator which allows auto-dispatch for your action creators.
For example:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Action } from 'redux';

@Injectable()
export class AnimalActions {
  static readonly LOAD_ANIMALS = 'LOAD_ANIMALS';

  // Calling loadAnimals will now automagically dispatch the action.
  @dispatch()
  loadAnimals = (animalType: AnimalType): Action => ({
    type: AnimalActions.LOAD_ANIMALS,
    meta: { animalType },
  })

  // ...
}
```

# 6.2.2

* Reset `MockNgRedux.mockInstance` as part of `MockNgRedux.reset()`.

# 6.2.1

## Fixes

Issue #370

## Misc.

* More code cleanup
* Auto-generated API documentation.

# 6.2.0 - NgReduxTestingModule

## Features

* Added `NgReduxTestingModule`, `MockNgRedux` to help unit test components and
services that select from the store. See [here](https://github.com/angular-redux/store/blob/master/articles/intro-tutorial.md#unit-testing-selections)
for details.
* Expose `PathSelector`, `FunctionSelector`, and `PropertySelector` types in `index.d.ts`.

## Misc.

* Simplified build toolchain
* Simplified unit testing toolchain
* Consolidated repo-specific examples in to the [example-app](https://github.com/angular-redux/example-app) repo.

# 6.1.0 - Angular 4 Support

Both version 2 and 4 of Angular are now supported. However Angular 2 support
is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.

# 6.0.1

Documentation updates; no code change. Added a 'getting started' tutorial.

# 6.0.0 - The big-rename.

Due to the impending release of Angular4, the name 'ng2-redux' no longer makes
a ton of sense.  The Angular folks have moved to a model where all versions are
just called 'Angular', and we should match that.

After discussion with the other maintainers, we decided that since we have to
rename things anyway, this is a good opportunity to collect ng2-redux and its
related libraries into a set of scoped packages. This will allow us to grow
the feature set in a coherent but decoupled way.

As of v6, the following packages are deprecated:

* ng2-redux
* ng2-redux-router
* ng2-redux-form

Those packages will still be available on npm for as long as they are being used.

However we have published the same code under a new package naming scheme:

* @angular-redux/store (formerly ng2-redux)
* @angular-redux/router (formerly ng2-redux-router)
* @angular-redux/form (formerly ng2-redux-form).

We have also decided that it's easier to reason about things if these packages
align at least on major versions. So everything has at this point been bumped
to 6.0.0.

# Breaking changes

Apart from the rename, the following API changes are noted:

* @angular-redux/store: none.
* @angular-redux/router: none.
* @angular-redux/form: `NgReduxForms` renamed to `NgReduxFormModule` for consistency.

# 5.1.1
# 4.2.4
# 3.3.10

### Fixes

Applied fix addressing #309 - select function called even if state does not change.

# 5.1.0

### Features

You can now get an observable to the root state by passing no arguments to
`ngRedux.select`:

```typescript
private this.rootState$: Observable<IAppState>;

constructor(ngRedux: NgRedux) {
  this.rootState$ = ngRedux.select();
}
```

### Changes

`ngRedux.dispatch()` has been tweaked to always run in the Angular zone. This
should prevent unexpected weirdness when dispatching from callbacks to 3rd-party
libraries. See #259 for further discussion.

### Misc.

* Refactored the example app a bit to split out the different selector demos instead
of lumping most of them into the counter component.
* Miscellaneous documentation updates.

# 5.0.0

* Fix for the `ERROR in NgReduxModule is not an NgModule` error thrown by Angular CLI.
* Remove deprecations.
* Breaking changes associated with Angular 2.4+.

### Breaking Changes

* Minimum Angular peer dependency is now 2.4.0
* Removed support for the `connect` pattern: it's simply not a good fit for Angular.
You should be using the `select` pattern now.
* Remove deprecated constructor arg for `NgRedux`.
* Minimum Angular peer dependency is now 2.4.0
* `NgReduxModule.forRoot` is no more. Now just import `NgReduxModule` directly.

#### Old Way:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { NgReduxModule } from 'ng2-redux';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    NgReduxModule.forRoot(),
    BrowserModule,
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
class AppModule {
  // etc.
}
```

#### New Way:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { NgReduxModule } from 'ng2-redux';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    NgReduxModule,
    BrowserModule,
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
class AppModule {
  // etc.
}
```

# 4.2.4

Recovery release that restores the functionality of 4.2.2. Use this release
if you're on Angular < 2.2. If your on Angular >= 2.3, you'll need to use
ng2-redux@5.0.0-beta.0 (see v5.x branch for the changelog) to consume the
fix for #282 (due to a breaking change in Angular).

# 4.2.1, 4.2.3

Botched releases - don't use. Apologies; I've added a `prepublish` script to `npm`
to prevent this from happening again.

# 4.2.1

### Fixes:

* #281 (DevToolsExtension missing from providers list)

# 4.2.0

### Fixes:

* #221 (type error with redux-thunk)

# 4.1.0

### Fixes:

* #228 ('generic' error with AoT)
* #251 (No provider for DevToolsExtension)

# 4.0.0

### Features

* Better support for Angular CLI
* NgModule interface changes to better support Angular 2's ahead-of-time compiler (AoT)

### Fixes

* Update build to use ngc - metadata.json is now produced
* Introduced NgReduxModule
* Fix AoT related bugs #247, #235, #228

### Breaking Change: Using NgReduxModule

```js
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { NgReduxModule, NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
import { IAppState } from './appstate';
import { rootReducer } from './store';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    NgReduxModule,
    BrowserModule,
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(ngRedux: NgRedux<IAppState>) {

    ngRedux.configureStore(rootReducer,{});
  }
}

```

**before**

```js
import { select } from 'ng2-redux';
export class MyComponent {
  @select() thing$:Observable<string>;
}
```

**after**

```js
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
export class MyComponent {
  thing$: Observable<string>;
  constructor(private ngRedux:NgRedux<MyAppState>) {

  }
  ngOnInit() {
    this.thing$ = this.ngRedux.select (n => n.thing);
  }
}
```

* [Select - seamless support for ImmutableJS](https://github.com/angular-redux/store/blob/master/articles/immutable-js.md) (#160)


### Fixes

* Able to use `@select` in services
* Behavior of `select` with chained dispatches, (fixes #149, #153)


# 3.2.0

### Features

* Added a `provideStore()` function which lets you pass in a already created
store. It can be used as this:

Create your store:
```typescript
// store.ts

import {
  applyMiddleware,
  Store,
  combineReducers,
  compose,
  createStore
} from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import reduxLogger from 'redux-logger';

import { myReducer } from './reducers/my-reducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  myReducer,
});

export const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  compose(
    applyMiddleware(
      thunk,
      reduxLogger
    )
  )
) as Store
```

Create your App and call `provideStore` with your newly created store:
```typescript
// app.ts

import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
import { store } from './store.ts';

interface IAppState {
  // ...
};
@Component({
  // ... etc.
})
class App {
  constructor(private ngRedux: NgRedux) {
    this.ngRedux.provideStore(store);
  }

  // ...
}
```

# 3.1.0

### Features

* Added a 'path' option to `ngRedux.select()` and `@select()`. Now you can
do stuff like `@select(['foo', 'bar'])` to select `state.foo.bar` into
an observable.

* Add ability to provide custom comparer to @select decorator to keep consistent with ngRedux.select

```js
import { is } from 'immutablejs'

export class SomeComponent {
  @select(n=n.some.selector, is) someSelector$: Observable<any>
}

```
### Features

# 3.0.8

### Fix

* AppliicationRef is optional dependency, fixes#127

# 3.0.0

### Features

#### Select Decorator
This release introduces the new decorator interface. You can now use
`@select`  to create an observable from a slice of store state.

See 'the select pattern' in [README.md](README.md#the-select-pattern)
for a complete description of how to use this new decorator.

#### Simpler Redux DevTools Integration

You no longer need to manually subscribe and `ApplicationRef.tick()`
for Redux DevTools to work; we do this automatically for you.

### Breaking Changes

#### Bootstrapping

We've changed how bootstrapping `ng2-redux` works. The `provider`
function has gone away in favour of making NgRedux a first-class
`@Injectable`.

You now configure your store in the constructor of your top-level
app component instead of prior to bootstrapping. This allows the
store to be configured with middleware and enhancers that rely on
Angular 2 services, which previously was unnecessarily difficult.

##### Old way:

**bootstrap.ts:**
```typescript
import { bootstrap } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
const createLogger = require('redux-logger');
const persistState = require('redux-localstorage');
import { rootReducer } from './reducers';
import { App } from './app';

// Confusing and hard to use with dependency injection.
const middleware = [ createLogger() ];
const enhancers = [ persistState('counter', { key: 'example-app' }) ];
const store = compose(
  applyMiddleware(middleware),
  ...enhancers)
    (createStore)(rootReducer);

bootstrap(App, [ provide(store) ])
```

**app.ts**
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class App {
  constructor(private ngRedux: NgRedux) {}
}
```

##### New way:

**bootstrap.ts:**
```typescript
import { bootstrap } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
import { App } from './app';

bootstrap(App, [ Ng2Redux ]);
```

**app.ts**
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
import { reduxLogger } from 'redux-logger';
import { initialState, rootReducer } from './reducers';

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class App {
  constructor(private ngRedux: NgRedux) {
    const middleware = [ reduxLogger ];
    const enhancers = [ persistState('counter', { key: 'example-app' }) ];

    // Easier to understand, and can use middleware or enhancers from DI.
    ngRedux.configureStore(rootReducer, initialState, middleware, enhancers);
  }
}
```

#### Example App Updates

The example app has been updated to use `@select` and a
DI-aware action creator service (`counter-actions.ts`). It now also
shows examples of using middleware and enhancers from the Redux
community: `redux-logger` and `redux-localstorage`.

# 2.2.2

### Features

* **Type definitions**:
  * Ported to typescript
  * Supports typed stores / reducers
  * Uses offical Redux type definitions
* **Type Injectable**:
  * Able to inject `NgRedux` into your component by type, and not need `@Inject('ngRedux')`
  * `@Inject('ngRedux')` still works

```typescript
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
// ...
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private ngRedux: NgRedux) {}
}
```
* **State as Observable**: Ability to expose parts of your state as an observable.

```typescript
select<S>(selector: string | number | symbol | ((state: RootState) => S), comparer?: (x: any, y: any) => boolean): Observable<S>;
    wrapActionCreators: (actions: any) => (dispatch: Redux.Dispatch<any>) => Redux.ActionCreator<{}> | Redux.ActionCreatorsMapObject;
```

Example use:

```typescript
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
// ...
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  countByKey$: Observable<number>;
  countByFunc$: Observable<number>;

  constructor(private ngRedux: NgRedux) {
    this.countByKey$ = this.ngRedux.select('count');
    this.countByFunc$ = this.ngRedux.select(state=>state.count);
  }
}
```

Also have the ability to provide a custom compare function.

```typescript
import { is, Map } from 'immutable';
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';

// ...
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  person$: Observable<Map<string,any>>;

  constructor(private ngRedux: ngRedux) {
    // even if the reference of the object has changed,
    // if the data is the same - it wont be treated as a change
    this.person$ = this.ngRedux.select(state=>state.people.get(0),is);
  }
}
```
